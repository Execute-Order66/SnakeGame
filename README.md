There isss a ssssnake among ussss. 
Sussy snake simulator comes complete with an Among us themed snake, Text, and fully functioning audio, as well as a timer to see how long you lasted.
You hsould also try pressing up down left right, and in that order, while the game is running to see what happens.
Or I could just tell you.
The snake slows down a little bit each time you do the sequence.
It does stack, the more you do it, the slower and more painful it becomes.
